# Codebase for deep self-driving perception

*PytorchAutoDrive* is a **pure Python** codebase includes semantic segmentation models, lane detection models based on **PyTorch**. Here we provide full stack supports from research (model training, testing, fair benchmarking by simply writing configs) to application (visualization, model deployment). Poster at PyTorch Developer Day: [PytorchAutoDrive: Toolkit & Fair Benchmark for Autonomous Driving Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EgcwPnKvAZJ1aWqBv6W9Msm666Wqi5a/view?usp=sharing).

*This repository is under active development, results with models uploaded are stable. For legacy code users, please check [deprecations](https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive/issues/14) for changes.*

## Highlights

Various methods on a wide range of backbones, **config** based implementations, **modulated** and **easily understood** codes, image/keypoint loading, transformations and **visualizations**, **mixed precision training**, tensorboard logging and **deployment support** with ONNX and TensorRT.

Models from this repo are faster to train (**single card trainable**) and often have better performance than other implementations, see [wiki](https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive/wiki/Notes) for reasons and technical specification of models.

*The VGG16 backbone corresponds to DeepLab-LargeFOV in SCNN.*

*The ResNet backbone corresponds to DeepLabV2 (w.o. ASPP) with output channels reduced to 128 as in RESA.*

*We keep calling it VGG16/ResNet for consistency with common practices.*

## Notes:

1. Cityscapes dataset is down-sampled by 2 when training at 256 x 512, to specify different sizes, modify them in config files if needed.

2. Training times are measured on **a single RTX 2080Ti**, including online validation time for segmentation, test time for lane detection.

3. All segmentation results reported are from single model without CRF and without multi-scale testing.
