# Codebase for deep autonomous driving perception tasks

Segmentation models (**Deeplab, FCN, ERFNet**), Lane detection models (**ERFNet, ERFNet-SCNN and others**) based on Python 3.6 and PyTorch >=1.6.0 (CUDA 10) & TorchVision >=0.7.0 with mixed precision training.

**This repository is under active development, which means performance reported could improve in the future. While results with models uploaded are probably stable.**

## Highlights

Fast probability map to poly line conversion, modulated (borrowed) mIOU & pixel acc calculation, "poly" learning rate schedule, basic input loading, transformations and visualizations, also tests of mixed precision training and tensorboard logging.

And models from this repo is faster (also better or at least similar) than the official implementations and other implementations out there.

## Preparations:

1. Setup a Python3 environment (CUDA 10), with PyTorch >= 1.6, TorchVision >= 0.7.0, tqdm, tensorboard, numpy, imageio, opencv-python, yaml.

2. Download the code:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive.git
cd pytorch-auto-drive
```

3. Prepare the code:

```
chmod 777 *.sh
mkdir output
```

## Enable tensorboard (optional):

```
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Getting started

Get started with [LANEDETECTION.md](LANEDETECTION.md) for lane detection.

Get started with [SEGMENTATION.md](SEGMENTATION.md) for semantic segmentation.

## Notes:

1. Cityscapes dataset is down-sampled by 2 when training at 256 x 512, to specify different sizes, modify them in [configs.yaml](configs.yaml); similar changes can be done with other experiments.

2. Training times are measured on **a single RTX 2080Ti**, including online validation time for segmentation, test time for lane detection.

3. All segmentation results reported are from single model without CRF and without multi-scale testing.

4. **Pull Requests** and **Issues** are most welcomed.
