# PytorchAutoDrive: Framework for self-driving perception

*PytorchAutoDrive* is a **pure Python** framework includes semantic segmentation models, lane detection models based on **PyTorch**. Here we provide full stack supports from research (model training, testing, fair benchmarking by simply writing configs) to application (visualization, model deployment).

**Paper:** [Rethinking Efficient Lane Detection via Curve Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02431) (CVPR 2022)

**Poster:** [PytorchAutoDrive: Toolkit & Fair Benchmark for Autonomous Driving Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EgcwPnKvAZJ1aWqBv6W9Msm666Wqi5a/view?usp=sharing) (PyTorch Developer Day 2021)

*This repository is under active development, results with models uploaded are stable. For legacy code users, please check [deprecations](https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive/issues/14) for changes.*

## Highlights

Various methods on a wide range of backbones, **config** based implementations, **modulated** and **easily understood** codes, image/keypoint loading, transformations and **visualizations**, **mixed precision training**, tensorboard logging and **deployment support** with ONNX and TensorRT.

Models from this repo are faster to train (**single card trainable**) and often have better performance than other implementations, see [wiki](https://github.com/voldemortX/pytorch-auto-drive/wiki/Notes) for reasons and technical specification of models.
